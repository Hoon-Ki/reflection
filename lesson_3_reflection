When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when i collaborate something with people, i want and have to share it to improve the project more efficiently


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It would be needed when the most recent work wasn't finished yet. so if let git automatically stay up-to-date, my codes could be messy. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks is very similar with clones but it's just on github.

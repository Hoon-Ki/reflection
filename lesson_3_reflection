When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when i collaborate something with people, i want and have to share it to improve the project more efficiently


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It would be needed when the most recent work wasn't finished yet. so if let git automatically stay up-to-date, my codes could be messy.
